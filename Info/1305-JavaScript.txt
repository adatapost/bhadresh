JavaScript
======================================================================

What is JavaScript?

 
  The JavaScript is dynamic, object-oriented, functional programming   language.

  The JavaScript language specifically used to develop client programs which are executed by the web-browsers but nows a day JavaScript is also used by the server-environment -- NodeJS.

  JavaScript program are embed/insert into web-page using <script> HTML   tag.

   e.g.

   <body>
     <script>
        var no  = 10;
        console.log(no);
     </script>
   .... 
   </body>

 
 1. JavaScript is case-sensitive language

 2. JavaScript code can be written anywhere within the web-document     using <script> tag.

 3. JavaScript code is interpreted by the JavaScript engine which is     available with any web-browser.

 4. JavaScript is not a Java language. Java language is completely     different.



What is dynamic language?

 
  In dynamic language, datatype is assigned to value instead of   variable.

     It means we can store different type data into variable:

     e.g   

            a = 10;  //integer

            a = "Hello";  //String


  PHP and JavaScript are example of dynamic language.
